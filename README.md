# ACCESSorise: Accessories Sharing App

## Description

ACCESSorise gives you ACCESS to a world of accessories at your fingertips - and all for free! Instead of buying a new pair of shoes or bag before a big event, why not check out your friends' accessory libraries and see if you can find something to borrow? Upload your own accessories and choose your preferred visibility - hiddden, visible only to friends, or visible to the general public - and get started sharing accessories today.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Once you've created an account, you'll have an option to add products. Fill in key product details and add an image (or many!). You can also browse accessories uploaded by other users, if they're set to public or you have them in your friends list. When you find an accessory that matches what you're looking for, click into the product page and press the 'Book' button to choose your booking date. You can also send a message to the owner if you have any questions.
